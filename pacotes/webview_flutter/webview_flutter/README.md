# WebView for Flutter

[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/webview_flutter.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter)

A Flutter plugin that provides a WebView widget.

On iOS the WebView widget is backed by a [WKWebView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview);
On Android the WebView widget is backed by a [WebView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView).

## Usage
Add `webview_flutter` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/platform-integration/platform-channels). If you are targeting Android, make sure to read the *Android Platform Views* section below to choose the platform view mode that best suits your needs.

You can now include a WebView widget in your widget tree. See the
[WebView](https://pub.dev/documentation/webview_flutter/latest/webview_flutter/WebView-class.html)
widget's Dartdoc for more details on how to use the widget.

## Android Platform Views
This plugin uses
[Platform Views](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/platform-integration/platform-views) to embed
the Androidâ€™s webview within the Flutter app. It supports two modes:
*hybrid composition* (the current default) and *virtual display*.

Here are some points to consider when choosing between the two:

* *Hybrid composition* has built-in keyboard support while *virtual display* has multiple
[keyboard issues](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Avd-only+label%3A%22p%3A+webview-keyboard%22).
* *Hybrid composition* requires Android SDK 19+ while *virtual display* requires Android SDK 20+.
* *Hybrid composition* and *virtual display* have different
  [performance tradeoffs](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/platform-integration/platform-views#performance).


### Using Hybrid Composition

The mode is currently enabled by default. You should however make sure to set the correct `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` if it was previously lower than 19:

```groovy
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 19
    }
}
```

### Using Virtual displays

1. Set the correct `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` (if it was previously lower than 20):

    ```groovy
    android {
        defaultConfig {
            minSdkVersion 20
        }
    }
    ```

2. Set `WebView.platform = AndroidWebView();` in `initState()`.
    For example:

    ```dart
    import 'dart:io';

    import 'package:webview_flutter/webview_flutter.dart';

    class WebViewExample extends StatefulWidget {
      @override
      WebViewExampleState createState() => WebViewExampleState();
    }

    class WebViewExampleState extends State<WebViewExample> {
      @override
      void initState() {
        super.initState();
        // Enable virtual display.
        if (Platform.isAndroid) WebView.platform = AndroidWebView();
      }

      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return WebView(
          initialUrl: 'https://flutter.dev',
        );
      }
    }
    ```

### Enable Material Components for Android

To use Material Components when the user interacts with input elements in the WebView,
follow the steps described in the [Enabling Material Components instructions](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/android#enabling-material-components).

### Setting custom headers on POST requests

Currently, setting custom headers when making a post request with the WebViewController's `loadRequest` method is not supported on Android.
If you require this functionality, a workaround is to make the request manually, and then load the response data using `loadHTMLString` instead.
